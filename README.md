# 8085-Labaratoriska2-Zadaca2
In memory, starting from memory location POCPOLE, 10 data are placed. Write an 8085-based assembly program that will process each of the data in the field as follows: If bits 3 and 7 of the read data are 1 and 0 respectively, then the data summed with 5 is sent to the output port with address FAh, otherwise, the data multiplied by 3 is sent.
